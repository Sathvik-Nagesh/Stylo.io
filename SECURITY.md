# Security Policy

## Security Features Implemented

### Backend Security
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers including CSP, HSTS, and XSS protection
- **CORS**: Configured for specific origins with credentials support
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per 15 minutes (5 for auth endpoints)
- **Input Validation**: Express-validator with sanitization
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds of 12
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure session configuration with MongoDB store
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling without sensitive data exposure
- **MongoDB Injection Protection**: Mongoose ODM prevents NoSQL injection

### Frontend Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: In production environments
- **Secure Storage**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage with proper cleanup
- **Input Sanitization**: Client-side input validation and sanitization
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookies and proper CORS configuration

### Data Protection
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **File Upload Security**: Size limits and type validation
- **Database Security**: MongoDB with proper indexing and validation
